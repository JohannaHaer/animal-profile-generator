# The Animal Profile Generator

Here, in the coming time, my passion project will take shape. 🐶🐱

In animal shelters, staff members still write profiles for their protégés in a thorough and dedicated manner. To reduce their workload while preserving the individuality and dedication in these profiles, I want to create a platform that allows shelter staff to enter information about the animals they want to rehome through a simple form. This information will then be transformed into a suitable profile using AI prompts, which will be stored in a database, printed, and hung up at the animals' stalls. Additionally, it can be directly uploaded to the website.

In the long term, it should also be possible to edit these individual texts.

I am incredibly excited about this project. So, let's stay tuned and bring this project to life together. 🚀
